## ğŸš€ Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-sass-starter
# or
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-sass-starter
```

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:
```
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
